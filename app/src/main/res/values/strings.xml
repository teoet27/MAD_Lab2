    <string name="faq_main_title">FAQ: let\'s talk about TimeBanking</string>
    <string name="faq_question_1">What is the concept behind the time-based currency?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_1">In economics, a time-based currency is an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account is the person-hour or some other time unit. In our system, everyone\'s contributions have the same value: one hour equals four credits. Then, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, thus four credits, which they can redeem for some time of service from another volunteer.</string>
    <string name="faq_question_2">How can I offer a timeslot?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_2">When you want to offer a timeslot, you just need to click the \"+\" button in the main page in order to fill a form and publish your offered timeslot. All the users will be able to see it and to start a chat with you in order to contract. Don\'t worry: you\'ll be able to edit your offered timeslot just clicking on it and selecting the \"pencil button\".</string>
    <string name="faq_question_3">I\'ve started a chat: now, how can I generate a proposal for the other user?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_3">Just clicking on the \"+\" button above the message input field: in this way, a pre-compiled form will be showed and you\'ll be able to generate a proposal which can be then accepted or rejected by the other user.</string>
    <string name="faq_question_4">How can I filter between all the available timeslots?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_4">There are several ways to filter the timeslots. You can select \"All services\" from the drawer menu to see the different skill categories. Otherwise, from the main page, you can click on \"Filter\" to select timeslots based on location, date and duration to best suit your needs. Then, you can sort the timeslots based on different criteria.</string>
    <string name="faq_question_5">Can I edit comments and rating on my profile?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_5">No, you cannot. All your received comments and ratings are visible to other users.</string>
    <string name="faq_question_6">How can I offer a proposal to ask for a service?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_6">Once you opened the chat with another user, a button will appear over the input field: by clicking on it, you will be able to present a proposal to them. In the proposal, you will select a location, a starting time and a desired duration: if you have enough credit for the selected duration and the offering user accepts your conditions, the transaction is completed.</string>
    <string name="faq_question_7">What is the state of a timeslot?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_7">A timeslot goes through several phases:\n\n- Available timeslot: it is the base state of a timeslot once it is created. It consists of a set of information: title, description, associated skills, restrictions, expected service duration, date and starting/ending time of availability (time range within which the server is available to provide the service). It will appear in the list of timeslots (home screen) once selected a specific service.\n- Active timeslot: it is the state corresponding to an activated service (i.e. when the advertisement owner and a client agreed on activating it). It will appear in the Active tab and will show information related to the trading between server and client (actual location, actual starting time, actual duration) when the activation period expires, the service must be rated and a button will appear to do it.\n- Ended timeslot: when an active timeslot is rated by both client and server, it becomes ended.\n- Expired timeslot: it is the state of a timeslot which has not been activated and whose ending time of availability has expired.</string>
